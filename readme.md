Have you been to any of these landmarks? Try swapping out the images for pictures that you took while you were there! You'll need to add your picture to the assets area of the project, copy its new link, and replace that value for the "photo": element of the right landmark in the landmarks.json file. You can also remove the values for the "photo_original": and "attribution": elements of that place (just leave a "" in place of the old value).

You can take this one step further and change the entire landmarks.json file! You can use https://www.latlong.net/ to get the latitude and longitude for the places in your file, and be sure to add either photos that you've taken yourself or that you have permission to use. You can check out https://commons.wikimedia.org/ to search for free-to-use images . Here are some ideas:
